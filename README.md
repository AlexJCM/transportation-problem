This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Pre-requisites

1. First we need to install Node.js https://nodejs.org/es/download/ as we are going to use npm to install ReactJs packages.
2. Check if Node is installed correctly by running: node -v
3. We cloned the repository of the project made with React.js
4. To run the project after it has been cloned, first enter that folder from the terminal and then run the npm install command to install the necessary packages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
