This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Pre-requisites

1. First we need to install Node.js https://nodejs.org/es/download/ as we are going to use npm to install React.js packages.
2. Check if Node is installed correctly by running: `node -v`
3. Now we proceed to clone the project's repository made with React.js
4. To run the project after it has been cloned, first enter that folder from the terminal and then run the `npm install` command to install the necessary packages.

## Available Scripts

After having completed the above steps successfully you can now execute:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
